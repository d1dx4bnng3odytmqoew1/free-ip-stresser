# 💣 Break It Before They Do: Aggressive Website Testing Service

Modern websites need more than pretty UIs. They need **resilience** — and that means withstanding spikes, bots, and even attacks. Our **intensive stress testing system** is built for this exact mission 🧠

## 🌪️ Extreme Load, Real Attacks

We don’t simulate fake users. We simulate **real attack vectors** — with volume. Our platform can send up to **5,000,000 RPS**, and every request can be crafted, targeted, and adapted on the fly.

### 🔧 What We Test:

- CDN and WAF behavior under high load
- Server CPU and memory spikes
- DB request thresholds
- Frontend rendering bottlenecks

If it breaks under traffic, we’ll find it.

## 🛡️ Adaptive Bypass Engine

Using **advanced algorithms**, we can break through almost any protection layer:

- Cloudflare? We solve JS challenges.
- DDoS-Guard? We rotate sessions and simulate browsers.
- AWS Shield? We push diversified traffic from global sources.
- Fastly? We mimic legit user behavior via headless automation.

> The goal? **Trigger no alarms. Break all defenses.**

## 🔬 Deep Technical Attack Stack

You choose the type of test:

- **Full-layer HTTP floods**
- **Randomized path floods**
- **CAPTCHA triggering without detection**
- **Exploit pattern injections** (optional)

All attacks are **stealth-tested first**, then scaled gradually — unless you want full blast from second zero 💥

## 📈 Insightful Data, Actionable Results

Our service doesn’t just “run a test” — it shows you **how and why your site reacts poorly**, and what part of the stack needs attention.

Reports include:

- Timeline-based traffic and crash logs
- Geo-based success/fail rates
- Layer 4/7 performance curves
- Detected protection response logs

## 👨‍💻 Who Is This For?

- Web developers running side projects or SaaS apps
- Hosting companies stress-testing shared servers
- Security researchers analyzing WAF behavior
- Technical bloggers wanting real world performance numbers
